# System Design

## What Is System Design?

System design is the process of planning how different parts of a software application will work together to meet functional (what it does) and non-functional (how well it does it) requirements.

It focuses on **architecture and structure**, not writing code.

## Why System Design Matters

- To handle growth (scalability)
- To avoid failures (reliability)
- To ensure speed (performance)
- To keep costs reasonable (efficiency)
- To allow maintenance and upgrades (flexibility)

## Real-World Analogy: Building a House

Before construction, you:

1. Gather requirements (size, rooms, materials).
2. Design structure and utilities (blueprints).
3. Consider safety and future expansion.

Likewise in software, you:

1. Understand requirements.
2. Decide architecture.
3. Plan communication and data handling.

## Key Elements of System Design

## 1. Architecture

- Defines the overall structure of the system
- Can be **monolithic**, **microservices-based**, or **event-driven**
- Determines how different modules are organized and deployed

## 2. Components

- Core building blocks of the system
- Includes **databases**, **servers**, **APIs**, **load balancers**, **message queues**, **cache systems**, etc.
- Each component has a specific responsibility

## 3. Interfaces

- Explain how components communicate with each other
- Common interface styles: **REST APIs**, **RPC calls**, **GraphQL**, **WebSockets**, **event streams**
- Ensures proper data flow and coordination between services

## 4. Data

- Covers how data is stored, retrieved, and managed
- Includes **databases**, **indexing**, **caching**, **replication**
- Focuses on **consistency**, **backups**, **recovery**, and **data security**

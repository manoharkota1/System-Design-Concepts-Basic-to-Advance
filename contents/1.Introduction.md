# Simple System Design

## What Is System Design?

System design is the process of planning how different parts of a software application will work together to meet functional (what it does) and non-functional (how well it does it) requirements.

It focuses on **architecture and structure**, not writing code.

## Why System Design Matters

- To handle growth (scalability)
- To avoid failures (reliability)
- To ensure speed (performance)
- To keep costs reasonable (efficiency)
- To allow maintenance and upgrades (flexibility)

## Real-World Analogy: Building a House

Before construction, you:

1. Gather requirements (size, rooms, materials).
2. Design structure and utilities (blueprints).
3. Consider safety and future expansion.

Likewise in software, you:

1. Understand requirements.
2. Decide architecture.
3. Plan communication and data handling.

## Key Elements of System Design

| Element      | Explanation                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture | Overall structure (monolithic, microservices, event-driven) |
| Components   | Databases, servers, APIs, load balancers, queues            |
| Interfaces   | How components communicate (REST, RPC, events)              |
| Data         | Storage, retrieval, consistency, backups                    |
